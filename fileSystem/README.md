# File System Project

In this project, I implemented a direct-index memory structure to store text data using C++. I built out the methods of FileSys.cpp using the provided code in Shell.cpp, Disk.cpp, Blocks.cpp, and BasicFileSystem.cpp (Not Provided). 

NOTE: .cpp implementations removed for school privacy reasons. I do not claim ownership of these implementations or intend to distribute them, but merely provide a basis for the code I've written.
